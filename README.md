# Data structures
The first algorithm, insertion sort, solves the sorting problem introduced in the first chapter on the book Intro to algorithm 3rd edition.
Insertion sort, which is an efficient algorithm for sorting a small
number of elements. Insertion sort works the way many people sort a hand of
playing cards. We start with an empty left hand and the cards face down on the
table. We then remove one card at a time from the table and insert it into the
correct position in the left hand. To find the correct position for a card, we compare
it with each of the cards already in the hand, from right to left.


Pseudo code from the book
for j = 2 to A.length
key = a[j]
// Insert A[j] into the sorted sequence A[1... j-1]
i= j - 1
while i > 0 and AOE[i] > key
  A[i+1] = A[i]
  i = i - 1
A[i + 1] key

we will use different algorithms and data strucures
